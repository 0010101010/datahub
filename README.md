# WhereHows

WhereHows is a data discovery and lineage tool built at LinkedIn. It integrates with all the major data processing systems and collects both catalog and operational metadata from them. 

Within the central metadata repository, WhereHows curates, associates, and surfaces the metadata information through two interfaces: 
* a web application that enables data & linage discovery, and community collaboration
* an API endpoint that empowers automation of data processes/applications 

WhereHows serves as the single platform that:
* links data objects with people and processes
* enables crowdsourcing for data knowledge
* provides data governance and provenance based on ownership and lineage
